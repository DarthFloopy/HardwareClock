# Hardware Clock
A simple chess clock app made in Java with Eclipse WindowBuilder. Use this on your laptop when you forget to bring a clock to chess club.
Just hit the left and right Shift keys on your keyboard as clock buttons, or use Space to toggle.


(Disclaimer: I wrote this quickly and hackily, so if you look at the code prepare to shield your eyes.)
