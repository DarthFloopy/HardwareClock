# Hardware Clock
A simple chess clock app made in Java with Eclipse WindowBuilder. Use this on your laptop when you forget to bring a clock to chess club.
Just hit the left and right Shift keys on your keyboard as clock buttons, or use Space to toggle.
Press "r" to reset the clock, "p" to pause and "q" to quit.

Usage: `( cd src && java com/josephcagle/hardwareclock/ClockPanel.java [timeControlInSeconds] )`
 or    `java -jar HardwareClock.jar`

(Disclaimer: I wrote this quickly and hackily, so if you look at the code prepare to shield your eyes.)
